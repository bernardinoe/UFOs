You can perform a search by entering different values. Data can be filter by Date, City, State, Country or Shape or a mix of them.

## Summary:

- The summary addresses one drawback of this webpage
A drawback is that the webpage can't filter a range of date.

- The summary addresses two additional recommendations for further development
I would add a filter for duration and modify the date filter for a range of dates. I would also implement an export tool.
